Week 2 Homework - Portfolio

## Description

The purpose of this project was to create a sample portfolio page to build on throughout the coding bootcamp course.

I learned how to:

<ul>
    <li>Use advanced CSS styling methods to add animation to links</li>
    <li>Add a background image to cover an entire page</li>
    <li>Add appropriate tags to combine CSS elements</li>
    <li>Properly position elements within the webpage</li>
</ul>

## Usage

Click one of the three hyperlinks at the top of the page to jump down the page to their descriptive content.
